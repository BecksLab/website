# Welcome to the People listing sub directory

## Understanding the workflow

Each person is an individual listing that is hosted on the `people` page. These are divided into current and past members that are specified in a `YAML` file (`people_current.yml` and `people_past.yml`), and the formatting is handled by the respective `.ejs.` files (`assets/ejs/`). 

It is thus important to remain consistent with the white spacing/tabbing as well as using the correct keys (categories). It is not critical that all keys have a value, however at a minimum one should provide the name, description, and email of each new member. 

When a member leaves the research group they must be moved from the current to past members file (you do not need to alter any of the information, just cut and paste).

Images for each member should be dropped in the `mugshots/` folder.
