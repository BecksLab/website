-   stance on doing responsible (do no harm) science

### Code of conduct

#### Flexible working hours

The assumption is that every member is already self-motivated and may choose to deviate from a traditional 9 to 5 to best suit their needs. They are welcome to send work-related messages, or submit pull requests outside of traditional working hours or days, with the expectation that other members are *not* required to respond to them outside of their typical working hours.

Members are welcome to work flexibly or remotely for any reason, however it is encouraged that they attend our weekly group meeting and to participate in activities.
