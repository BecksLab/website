We connect foraging biology and species interactions to explore the dynamics of species and the stability, structure and function of ecological communities.

[How has ancient climate change driven patterns of diversity, stability, and the resilience of paleo communities?]{.research-question}

Food webs provide us with a means to understand community structure, and provides us a framework to understand how extinctions lead to the reorganisation or collapse of communities, ultimately allowing us to understand the reorganisation of communities following perturbation events.

<!-- PROJECT 2 -->
## <i class="fa-solid fa-carrot"></i> Optimal Foraging

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-5}
We explore how optimal foraging and other traits underpin predictions about the dynamics and stability of communities facing multiple simultaneous threats.

[How does food web structure determine the temporal stability of ecological communities?]{.research-question}

We work on how community structure and species interactions affect community stability.
