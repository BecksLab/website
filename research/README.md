# Welcome to the Research listing sub directory

This folder hosts the various subfolders for the different research themes. Each theme should be self contained within its own folder - this includes images.

## Adding a new research theme

Any folders that are created in this directory will automatically be rendered as its own page

## Basic files structure and purpose

-   `index.qmd`: this is where you place page content
-   `hero_image.html`: you must edit this to update both the path to the hero image (banner at the top of the page) as well as the text that will be displayed over it.
