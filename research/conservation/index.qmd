The core underlying ethos running through all of my research is a drive to solve global challenges. I am currently focussed on, and working towards, describing biodiversity change and its drivers, and identifying pathways towards biodiversity protection and recovery, all whilst balancing the needs of people and society.

[How has conflict modified human-wildlife conflict?]{.research-question}


We work on understanding human-wildlife interactions in human dominated landscapes in Africa. In particular we are interested in understanding diet shifts of large carnivores and how they adapt to changing environments.

We work on parrots, linking their demography to socioeconomic constraints and trade-offs that influence their management as endangered species. 

We have long term collaborations with the World Parrot Trust centred on biological and social science research into what makes parrot conservation work. We work in Bonaire on Yellow Shouldered Amazons, in Costa Rica on McCaws and theoretically on the demography and economics of parrots.
